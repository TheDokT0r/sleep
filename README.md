# sleep-but-simple
The simplest sleep package on NPM!

## Why tho?
Because for some reason, most of the main sleep packages on npm have so much features dumbed into them, when all most people need is a simple sleep function.

## Intallation
```
npm i sleep-but-simple
```

if you're not using sleep in production, then you should use instead:

```
npm i --save-dev sleep-but-simple
```
